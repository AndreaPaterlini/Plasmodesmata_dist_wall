In this document we offer the opportunity to test the pipeline on some sample data before applying it to your own data. You don't have to download the data if don't feel like it, you can also just follow the text.

<br>

# Download the data 

<br>

We have uploaded **Example datasets** to the Apollo data repository. Please download the folder from [here](actual link) and store it on your computer. Unzip the *Data_individual_cells* folder and don't rename it as we will use it as the working directory. In the case of your own data you can have a name different from for your folder. However, bear in mind that you will need to change the scripts provided in this pipeline accordingly. We will now open the data in [the next section](#open). 

<br>

# Open the data {#open} 

<br>

In the unzipped folder you will find a series of files of different types. Here is a snapshot image showing them

In the folder there are datasets from 2 different Col-0 samples (WT *Arabidopsis thaliana* roots). The data associated with each sample are shown with the vertical brown and light blue bars in the image. For each of these two samples, multiple cells are provided. Each cell dataset has 3 files associated with it to start with (more will be generated as we go along the pipeline).

You should see a *.am* file (blue box), which contains the image stack itself (and is indeed the heaviest file), a *.model* file (green box) which contains the cell wall model (this has already been generated, in the case of your own data you would have to carefully generate this model as described in the paper and using the tools of the MIB software) and a *.ann* file (yellow box) containing the annotated PD positions (again for your datasets you would have to generate this on your own). We will now load the data in [the next section](#load). 

<br>

# Load the data {#load} 

<br>

To load and operate on the data you will need the MIB software[^3], you can download it from [this website](http://mib.helsinki.fi/). Please see the *Downloads* tab for the version that might best suit your system requirements. 
The *Matlab version* requires you to have a version of the proprietary Matlab software. If you don't there is no need for you to purchase such programme, just downlaod a *Standalone version* of MIB.

To familiarise yourself with the sofware interface and learn about its function see the *Tutorials* tab on the MIB website. The tutorials will be particularly useful to generate the models of the cell wall (which is a step we already performed here).

Lauch the MIB software. Load the dataset by defining the folder path in the upper bar and double clicking on the dataset of interest among those appearing in the left panel. Models should be loaded from the segmentation panel in the lower left half of the workspace. Lastly PD annotations should be loaded via the annotation option in the bottom left side. 

Once you have completed these tasks you should see the following view. Please note that here we are using the first dataset contained in the *Data_individual_cells* folder (*_PPP1-EN.am). The cell wall model is shown in green, superimposed on the original image stack. Annotations are shows as crosses in yellow with text next to the. Black circles in the image point to the functions previously described to load the various components.

You are now ready to proceed to the actual analysis pipeline [in the Distributions section](distributions.html).
